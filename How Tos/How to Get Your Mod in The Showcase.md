# How to Get Your Mod in The Showcase

We prefer to get submissions via Pull Request. But we realize not everyone can do that.

If you cannot make a Pull Request, you will need to [fill this form](https://campaigntrailshowcase.com/campaign-trail/submit.html) and upload your mods. They will be auto renamed. Please only fill this form out once.

Thanks!
