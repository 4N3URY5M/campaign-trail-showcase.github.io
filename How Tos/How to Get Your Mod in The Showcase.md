# How to Get Your Mod in The Showcase

When you submit a mod it can be in one of two areas of the site: the "Showcase" section and the "Community" section. Not all mods submitted will be in "Showcase" section, but we don't believe in gatekeeping creators who spent a lot of time and effort from the site. Therefore upon submission we will play the mod and decide if it is up to Showcase standards. If not, we will gladly host in the Community section so you can share it with people easily!

We prefer to get submissions via Pull Request. But we realize not everyone can do that.

If you cannot make a Pull Request, you will need to fill this out:

```
Mod Name: YOUR MOD NAME HERE
Best Place to Contact You: DISCORD/REDDIT/ETC USERNAME HERE
Placement: Do you want your mod to be Featured or Community? If itâ€™s declined as featured would you like it added as a Community mod?
Link to Code 1: LINK HERE
Link to Code 2 LINK HERE
Description/Additional Info (Optional): PUT ANYTHING ELSE WE MAY NEED TO KNOW HERE
```

And then copy it and create a Github issue using [this link](https://github.com/campaign-trail-showcase/campaign-trail-showcase.github.io/issues/new/choose).

Paste your filled out form and then post the issue. We will get back to you once we have reviewed your mod.

[Here is an example to follow](https://github.com/campaign-trail-showcase/campaign-trail-showcase.github.io/issues/4)

Thanks!
