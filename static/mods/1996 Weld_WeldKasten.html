You feel a little guilty for basically vibing your way to reelection, however slim, but it is what it is. Hopefully you can oversee another four years of prosperity and pass the torch to another moderate Republican in 2000. Whatever happens, best of luck!</p>",

Neither can your staff, neither can Casey, and neither can the anchors on CNN. Never in your wildest dreams had you anticipated for the election to get so close that the Electoral College deadlocked. They're probably going to schedule the contingent election sometime in early January so that it can be decided by the new Congress.</p><p>Unfortunately, Democrats control a majority of the state delegations after their strong gains in 1994. Barring any major surprises, they are sure to vote party-line and elevate Bob Casey to the presidency. So prepare to ensure a smooth transition of power, get packing for Massachusetts, and get to work planning your presidential library. Best of luck in your post-presidency!</p>",

None of your advisors could have guessed that these, even after snowballing for the entire campaign season, could cause you to lose outright. Your defeat will go down in history as an embarrassing blow to the GOP, a forfeiture of what was supposed to be a layup election with the state of the economy and your own approval ratings.</p><p>On that dour note, where does this leave you? You’re still President for three months, and your primary goal has become to facilitate a smooth transfer of power with President-Elect Casey. You’re also going to have to pack your bags and prepare to move back to the Bay State, where you’ll have to start planning your presidential library. Best of luck with the future, whatever it holds!</p>",
