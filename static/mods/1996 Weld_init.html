His second term sees a stagnant economy, rampant stagflation, and poor approval ratings. Unable to stop the Republicans even after the ablatross of Watergate, Democrats unedergo a full-blown identity crisis, as dozens of major contenders throw their hats into the ring in 1980. The evenutal victor is none other than George Corley Wallace, rising from the ashes in his final presidential run. Wallace does not prove to be an effective or competent President. His cabinet is rife with infighting due to his hands-off leadership style, and his own poor heath leads him to be absent from the public eye for prolonged periods of time. In March 1983, Wallace dies from a stress-induced heart attack. Vice President Michael Dukakis assumes the Presidency, and Edmund Muskie is appointed Vice President as a reward for a career of party solidarity and loyalty. Dukakis becomes a surprisingly able leader, leading his party to victory against Phil Crane in 1984 and Pat Robertson in 1988. Also in 1988, an old, tired Muskie retires, and Dukakis ally Patrick Leahy is elected in his place. By 1990, Dukakis has lost his luster. The Republicans, launching a backlash after three straight losses, rally around Governor Bill Weld. Despite Weld being very liberal for a Republican, he recieves almost unanimous party support, mostly out of utter desparation to stop the Dukakis machine. Weld easily defeats Vice President Leahy, swept into office on a promise to be “a new type of Republican.” This is where you pick up.</p><p>Here is some bonus content — wikiboxes and other canonical media from this timeline.</p><a href='https://i.imgur.com/mmpbfKq.png'>1980 election (full collage)</a><br><a href='https://i.imgur.com/N73gGYl.png'>1992 election (full collage)</a><br><a href='https://i.imgur.com/CCibPMz.png'> 1996 election (full collage)</a><br><a href='https://i.imgur.com/caVHHa0.png'>Election wikiboxes, 1980-1996</a><p>If you have any questions about the lore, you know where to find me.
